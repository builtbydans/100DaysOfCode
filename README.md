# 100 Days Of Code

**Day 1** - I decided to start my journey with the Scrimba Frontend Developer path. In the first module
            'Web Dev Basics', I looked at the basic HTML strucutre and commonly-used elements to help
            build out your HTML. These included heading tags, anchor tags, unordered and ordered list tags and button tags. The main project iof the day was to recreate the Google landing page with pre-written CSS supplied.

**Day 2** - The second day of the module focussed on basic CSS. I continued to work on our Google
            project but instead writing the CSS from scratch. I was introduced to concepts such as display attributes, the box model and using flex-box. I was also exposed to looking at short-hand CSS attributes and how important accessibility is when using <img> tags and designing your frontend. The main project(s) of the day were to recreate the Google clone, build a digital business card using flex-box and increasing the complexity of the CSS we use by building a Space Exploration landing page.

**Day 3** - Today was a pure focus on Flex Box and the different attributes that form part of it. I
            looked at more complex use cases for align-items and justify-content, including looking at
            how to better layout the page taking the x and y axis into account. There was also an introduction to small CSS interactivity inlcuding the hover psuedo code and creating text-shadows and background gradients. The capstone project for the day was to build a birthday website with an image of a gift - when the user would hover over the gif they would be presented with a GIF.
