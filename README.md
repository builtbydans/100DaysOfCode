# 100 Days Of Code

**Day 1** - I decided to start my journey with the Scrimba Frontend Developer path. In the first module
            'Web Dev Basics', I looked at the basic HTML strucutre and commonly-used elements to help
            build out your HTML. These included heading tags, anchor tags, unordered and ordered list tags and button tags. The main project iof the day was to recreate the Google landing page with pre-written CSS supplied.

**Day 2** - The second day of the module focussed on basic CSS. I continued to work on our Google
            project but instead writing the CSS from scratch. I was introduced to concepts such as display attributes, the box model and using flex-box. I was also exposed to looking at short-hand CSS attributes and how important accessibility is when using <img> tags and designing your frontend. The main project(s) of the day were to recreate the Google clone, build a digital business card using flex-box and increasing the complexity of the CSS we use by building a Space Exploration landing page.

**Day 3** - Today was a pure focus on Flex Box and the different attributes that form part of it. I
            looked at more complex use cases for align-items and justify-content, including looking at
            how to better layout the page taking the x and y axis into account. There was also an introduction to small CSS interactivity inlcuding the hover psuedo code and creating text-shadows and background gradients. The capstone project for the day was to build a birthday website with an image of a gift - when the user would hover over the gif they would be presented with a GIF.

**Day 4** - The course introduced us to JavaScript. The main focus was learning how variables work
            and how we can use DOM manipulation to change the state of the website. We were also introduced to basic datatypes such as string and number. By using the Console and console.log() function, I was able to debug my code and analyse what values were being returned. With this new knowledge, I created the capstone project of the day which was to create a person counter that had an increment button and a save button. One function incremented the counter element on the page and the save() function would save the state in another element that tracked the count.

**Day 5** - As we delve deeper into JS, the course then forces you to apply the learning thus far
            in the last 5 days by building a game score counter. This is built from scratch, including
            the UI. I started the project by breaking the main functions of the program into small tasks.
            I first started with creating the UI, so focussing on the CSS and HTML structure, making sure
            I am using id's and classes correctly. Then, with styling I used Flexbox and made sure that I followed the Figma design that was given to us. Finally, I created the JavaScript functions to increment the game score and as part of the stretch goal, I created a reset button which essentially reset the count variable and changed the DOM elements back to '0'.

**Day 6** - Deep dive into JavaScript today working on the capstone prokject 'Blackjack'. Ths brought together all the previous learnings including
            DOM manipulation, variables and introduced me to objects, callback functions and conditionals. The objective of the game was to render Blackjack to the client, which consisted of a button to generate a new card which calls a function that uses the Math() library. We then looked at using arrays to store the values of the card and then using a for loop to go through the array and send the values to the sum variable, which then would output the correct action depending on the score.
